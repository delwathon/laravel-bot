There is need to update all of the following:

The unrealized P&L percentage on the monitoring script table (Unrealized P&L column) should be leverage-aware: https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Profit-Loss-calculations-USDT-Contract/#B

signal_id should also be stored in positions table, so that when admin trade is closed in the Admin Trade page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/trades), it closes for all propagated users with same signal_id too.

Scheduled/background balance sync has failed to work. Fix things

Scheduled signal generator & Manual Generate Now button not working.
