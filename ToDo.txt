There is need to update all of the following:

Update Javascipt alert on admin trades page and signal generator page to use bootstrap 5

The unrealized P&L percentage on the monitoring script table (Unrealized P&L column) should be leverage-aware: https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Profit-Loss-calculations-USDT-Contract/#B

signal_id should also be stored in positions table, so that when admin trade is closed in the Admin Trade page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/trades), it closes for all propagated users with same signal_id too. This is the best approach.

Limit and Market Order type in Signal generator, not all signals are market order signal

On Trade page, limit order type fails for users as it attempts to execute as market

Generate Now does not execute signal for admin. It must execute for admin first, only admin successful execution should propagate to users. If it fails for a particular user, it shouldn't break the execution for other users

Signal Generator must obey system and signal settings/configuration, including auto-execution

All Scheduled or Job features has failed to work including scheduled signal generation and balance syncing. Fix this

When a trade is closed, ensure that the P&L stored is recalculated to exclude trade-fees

Implement close all positions to also close for users, not only admin

Updated admin dashboard implementation

User email verification

User subscription

Implement partial profit taking and SL adjustment
